## 🐳 Option 4: Docker Container (Advanced)

For consistent deployment across different systems:

### Create Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Create this file: Dockerfile
FROM node:18-slim

# Install Chrome dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    chromium \
    --no-install-recommends \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
RUN npx playwright install chromium

COPY . .
RUN chmod +x scrape-linkedin.js

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "scrape-linkedin.js"]
```

### Build and Share
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t linkedin-scraper .

# Share via Docker Hub
docker tag linkedin-scraper YOUR-DOCKERHUB-USERNAME/linkedin-scraper
docker push YOUR-DOCKERHUB-USERNAME/linkedin-scraper
```

### Others Can Use It
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/images:/app/images linkedin-scraper "https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/"
```

## 💻 Option 5: Executable Binary (Easiest for Users)

Create standalone executables that don't need Node.js:

### Install PKG
```bash
npm install -g pkg
```

### Create Binaries
```bash
# Create executables for different platforms
pkg scrape-linkedin.js --targets node18-mac,node18-win,node18-linux --output dist/linkedin-scraper

# This creates:
# - dist/linkedin-scraper-macos (for Mac)  
# - dist/linkedin-scraper-win.exe (for Windows)
# - dist/linkedin-scraper-linux (for Linux)
```

### Share the Executables
Users can just download and run:
```bash
# Mac/Linux
./linkedin-scraper-macos "https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/"

# Windows  
linkedin-scraper-win.exe "https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/"
```
